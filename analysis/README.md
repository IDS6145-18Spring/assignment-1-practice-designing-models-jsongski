## Smart City Reusable Shopping Bag System Simulation

**Discrete-event based simulation** can be used for the bag distribution and production system. However, **agent based simulation** would be useful when examining consumer behavior to determine the use/return rate for reusable bags.

(remove: Why did you choose this simulation type?)
The life cycle of reusable bags from production to circulation to composting can be tracked in discrete stages.

Agent based modeling can be used to simulate consumer behavior and decision making depending on features integrated into the system (e.g., a mobile app with motivational features such as reminders and incentives), as well as individual differences in customers (e.g., motivation, conscientiousness, forgetfulness, etc.).

Rather than having individual stores order bags on an ongoing basis, which would be inefficient for BagBot, clean and dirty bags will be delivered and collected on a weekly schedule following an optimized route to minimize fuel consumption.

(remove: Roughly, how would you conduct the simulation to produce the results from your specification?)

For the discrete-event based simulation of the bag management system, given some prior information that stores could provide, such as foot traffic, reusable bag use/return rate per store, as well as the failure rate (i.e., what percentage of bags are damaged and need to be removed from circulation), 

Agent based modeling can be used to simulate how people make decisions to participate in the smart bag program.
