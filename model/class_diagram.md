## Smart Orlando Reusable Bag System (SmartORBS) Model - Class Diagram


Looking more specifically, the current project focuses on the interaction between Bag HQ, stores, kiosks, and customers. In future work, the effect of mobile app use can be added to alter customer behavior, and the automated vehicle delivery system can also be explored.

The below class diagram focuses on specific subclasses involved in the bag inventory management portion of SmartORBS:
* Customers who participate in the SmartORBS program
* Bags
* Stationary structures
  * Bag HQ
  * Store
  * Kiosk

The bag inventory management portion of the system focuses, unsurprisingly, on bags. The class diagram details the classes involved in the production, exchange, and destruction (or theft) of bags within the system.
