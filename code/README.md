## Smart Orlando Reusable Bag System (*SmartORBS*) Model

While the problem at hand is complex and multifaceted, the current project focuses on an automated system that manages reusable bag supplies across participating stores. The system comprises a central bag management facility (Bag HQ), bags, stores, return kiosks, and customers.

The automated system will detect how many bags are needed to meet customer demand, and will track inventory over time to determine how many new bags need to be produced to meet demand.

Additionally, the system will track the location of each bag throughout its life cycle.

The simulation will be run in [**BagBot**](code/smart_orbs/bagbot.py).
